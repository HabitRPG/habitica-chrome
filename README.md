# HabitRPG Chrome Extension

Think Stayfocusd for [HabitRPG](http://habitrpg.com). Lose HP for visiting vice domains (procrastination websites), lingering on vice domains each 5m, etc. To use, enter your [HabitRPG user ID](https://img.skitch.com/20120829-qimntrn2qkra78wytxpujrh12a.jpg) in the options page. [Hit me up with suggestions](https://github.com/lefnire/habitrpg-chrome/issues) on what else the extension could track. I was thinking marking items complete in Pivotal Tracker, Workflowy, etc. would give you Exp, but then you wouldn't gain those points if the tickets were handled outside Chrome (phone app, etc).

Please bear with me on the current bugs, I'm still stablizing HabitRPG's API, then I'll come back & improve this extension. See the [roadmap here](https://workflowy.com/shared/b5eecfbd-4e76-cdcf-624e-529cd65f6ada/).
